### [Bergelson Lab] Shiny for CDI & Motor Datasets

These are R scripts for Shiny app. CDI & Motor Datasets aren't publicly released at this point. Please change the CDI & Motor file paths (the "load csv data" section of `clean_data.R`)  to your local ones, and set the file path where you want to save the cleaned datasets (the "save cleaned data" section of `clean_data.R`, and the "load datasets" section of `global.R`)

To run the Shiny app:
* Run `clean_data.R` if it's your first time running this app (one-time);
* Open `ui.R`, `server.R`, or `global.R` script, and click the `Run App` button in Rstudio.
